I have made an project using Headers (<h1>, <h2>, etc.) to organize sections clearly.

Paragraphs (<p>) for painting descriptions.

Line breaks (<br>) for spacing between content.

Table (<table>) listing paintings and their artists.

Italics (<i>) for painting titles to follow standard writing style.

Paintings Included in the project:

Mona Lisa — Leonardo da Vinci

The Starry Night — Vincent van Gogh

Girl with a Pearl Earring — Johannes Vermeer
